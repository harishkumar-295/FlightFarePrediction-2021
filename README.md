# Overview

This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

# Motivation

I started to learn different Machine Learning model to understand it and get most out of it by applying to real world problems. I understood the mathematics behind all supervised models i.e for this problem problem I used a Regression model. Finally I applied it this problem.
